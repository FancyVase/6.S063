  <h1><b>Project Name:</b> Clairvoyance</h><br>
    <h2><b>Team Members:</b> Jisoo Min, Hiram Moncivais</h>
      <h3>Our idea</h3>
      When people are too focused, they often don't realize others approaching them. 
      We will create a tool that detects motion, and notifies the user about 
      someone approaching him/her.
      The idea can be expanded to people who have visual impairments,
      and can only see a very narrow window in front of them. We hope to 
      build something that increases people's field of view.

      <h1><b>Project Overview (HW 10)</b></h1>
      1. We chose to build an assistive technology device that can sense people 
      approaching from outside the field of view. <br><br>
      2. How the project fulfills the requirements:
      <ul>
        <li> some lasercut/3D printed parts: We will 3D print a casing for our electronics and most of the tangible parts of the project.</li>
        <li>custom electronics: We will include an infrared sensor, a camera, and a wifi module to transfer the detected data to our server.</li>
        <li>custom code and data being send via wifi: We will send the movement and face recognition data sensed by the IR sensor and camera via wifi, process it and display it to our user.</li>
        <li>react to user input: A user will be able to tweak the sensitivity of Clairvoyance. They can specify whether they should be notified when approached from behind, the sides, or both.</li>
        <li>must solve a real-world problem: People who have impaired vision are shocked when approached from the sides. Similarly, people with regular vision who are focused while working may also be startled when approached from behind. With Clairvoyance, we hope to increase people's field of view. </li>

      </ul>
      3. A clear description of what the final demo will be (what you will show in the last week of the semester): 
      <ul>
        <li>A showcase of the different features in Clairvoyance both as an assistive technology and as a sense-enhancing tool.</li>
      </ul>
